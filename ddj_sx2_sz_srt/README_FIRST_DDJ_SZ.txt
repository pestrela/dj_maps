There are two versions of the mapping: WITH or WITHOUT bome.

The BOME version is much newer, has unique features like jog screens, and is the only getting updates.
However installation is more complex, and a BOME license costs 60 eur after testing.

The documentation and the installation guide is only updated on the BOME version as well.
