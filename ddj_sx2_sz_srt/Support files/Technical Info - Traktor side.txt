A friendly request:
-------------------
  Please don't be disrespectful for the time that people spend to make complex mappings.
  Do not press a thumb down without leaving the steps to reproduce any issue you might have. 
  In the majority of the cases this will actually be an user error. Thank you.

BOME installation guide:
------------------------
  I've now made a video to show step-by-step how to install my BOME traktor mappings for Pioneer controllers. 
  This is very important as all I've migrated most my mappings to BOME, namely the DDJ-SX2/SZ/SRT mapping.
 
  The BOME trial means you can try my mapping for free.

History Overview / Future plans:
--------------------------------
	DDJ-S* 2019 thread: http://forum.djtechtools.com/showthread.php?t=95073&page=5

	- I’m maintaining the most advanced mapping for ddj-*, made by JAJA 
		(v5.2.3, the map with the most functions and most downloads). 
		Because the midi codes are the same, 95% of mapping works in all ddj-s
		and ddj-r controllers.

	- On v6.0.0 of this mapping i’ve added macroFX plus a lot more fixes/changes. 
		The last 5% was made specific for the SZ in TP2. 

	- The v6.1.0 version adds the TP3 functions of mixerFX and slip reverse on top of everything else, 
		including a very easy way to access the most common functions (arrow left twice/arrow right). 
		It was also made tight for the SX2 as the video shows. 
		It works on TP2 except the TP3 specific functions. 

	- The next version for TP3 will be made tight for the SZ as well, plus more functions of course. 

	- A spin-off will be translating 1000s of entries for the ddj-1000/ddj-400 midi codes. 
		This will be a one way process, and I expect to need to maintain the two maps in parallel for years.﻿
 
 
FX unit usage overview:
-----------------------
FX Unit1 - Group mode - All to DeckA
  - slot1: turntableFX 
  - slot2: delay releaseFX    (TODO)
  - slot3: macroFX

FX Unit2:
  - Same as unit1, but for deck B
  
FX Unit3:
  - jogFX for any deck
  
FX Unit4:
  - slot1: BeatFX per channel
  - slot2: 
  - slot1: 
  
  
 
  
Merged mapping DDJ-1000 and DDJ-SZ:
-----------------------------------  
  on CMDR, select interaction: "encoder relative"
  - Scratch (dug)
    - SX2:
      - sensitivity:  10
      - acceleration: 19
    - SR:
      - sensitivity:  25
      - acceleration: 19
    - 1000:
      - sensitivity:  5
      - acceleration: 14

  - JogFX 2 knobs:
    - SX2:
      - knob1:  25/0
      - knob2+3: 20/0
    - SR:
      - (NOT FIXED - SAME AS SX2)
    - 1000:
      - knob1:   12/0
      - knob2+3:  8/0
      
FX units usage:
---------------   
	FX1|FX2 = PADFX, macroFX, TTFX
	FX3 = JOG FX + echo release
	FX4 = beatFX
      
  
Modifiers TSI page 1:  VINYL BREAK, JOG FX, CENSOR OUT, ROLL, GRID ADJUST, BROWSER, SX2

	M1: (EXTRA SHIFTS - HOLD STYLE)
	 0: nothing pressed
	 
	 1-4: deck A-D SELECT  <<<<< MEMORY shift2  
	    for waveform zoom. this is because browser has no deck number!

	    note: use M1=1 == deck A, M1=2 == deck B, etc. Assumes dedicated Memory button!
      
	 5: vinyl stop in progress (REQUIRES PROGRESSIVE TEMPO BEND = extra settings)
		  m2 = 5=adjust / 6=slide

	 7: doing PREVIEW PLAYER

	M2: JOG STATUS / WHICH DECK IS BEING USED FOR JOG FX?
	   0: SCRATCH enabled (HOT CUE  mode)

		 2: Jog FX is being touched
     3: Loop adjust in progress  <<<<<  NEW
     
     4: Memory/search pressed (for quick search)
   
		 5: Grid ADJUST pressed  -> this cancels jogfx mode   F7
		 6: Grid SLIDE  pressed  -> this cancels jogfx mode   E7
		 7: (empty)
        XDJ-XZ: reverse (why ????)
		 
	M3: JOGFX SELECTION  (SHARED BETWEEN ALL DECKS)
	  0- none
	  1-7: which jog FX
	
  
  
	M4:  AJUST LOOP __IN PROGRESS__   (ALL DECKS)  <<<< THIS IS TO SIMPLIFY A LOT

	M8: ECHO OUT FAVORITE
		(sequence is 3,1,2,0 )

Slicer info:
------------           
 slicer jaja:
  mode1:    8 slices, 1/1
  mode2:   16 slices, first 1/2      <<<<< default for rekordbox
  mode2:   16 slices, second 1/2 
  
  8 beats, 16 slices, first 1/2
  conclusion: simplest is mode1, and reduce the loop size by hand
  
 most useful case:
  8 beats, first 1/2

	to access configuation: press left shift + left play + turn on device
	slip reverse on  = forced midi mode
	slip reverse off = automatic change when rekordbox is running

  
	
DDJ-1000 Back-2-back USAGE (2x USB):
------------------------------------
 - setting USB_A/LINE/USB_B selector controls who receives MIDI commands (in/out) only for selected deck
   - ie: jogwheels, play/pause, pads, browser.
	 
 - this parameter affects ALL mixer controls
   - gain, volume, EQ, cross fader
	 - all beatFX (including dry/wet)
	 - colorFX buttons
	 - Filter knob
	 
	 - exception: headphone CUE button
   
   
DDJ-1000 with external soundcards:
----------------------------------
  As explained on the "caveats section", the pioneer effects are only applied to the master channel OR for external inputs. 
  Internal inputs will have traktor effects, unless you select "MST" (that affects all decks).

  A workaround is using an external sound card like an audio6, as follows:
  - Traktor MIDI control: channel 1+2
  - Audio6 external sound card: channel 3+4

  this is the same setup as this Serato + DDJ-1000 video:

DDJ-SZ encoder mode:
--------------------
	jog:      41/3f
	Browser:	01/7E
	FX beat:  01/7E
		


  
DDJ-SR/RR support:
------------------
	The whole SX2 map is compatible with the SR and RR controllers. 
  
  Only differences are:
  - higher resolution jogwheels require higher sensitivity in all jog commands
    - jog turn
    - jogFX knob
    
  - shift2 button is missing. This is now mapped to loop capture button  
  - pad modes sequence: minor or no differences at all
   
   


	
deck shift codes:
-----------------
  shift2:
    DDJ-SZ deck change:
      deck 1: ch1 F#8 / g#8
      deck 2: ch2 F#8 / g#8
      deck 3: ch3 F#8 / g#8
      deck 4: ch4 F#8 / g#8
    
    DDJ-1000 deck change: 
      only ch3 F#8, both ON and OFF
    
    memory: c#4 / d4
	
  
	quantize (hot cue long): a#7
	quantize (ddj-1000):     F3 / A3

	
	auto loop:  G#0 / G#5   (DDJ-1000 + DDJ-SZ)
	
	loop in:    E0 / E5     (DDJ-1000 + DDJ-SZ)
	loop out:   F0 / F5     (DDJ-1000 + DDJ-SZ)
	
  loop 1/2:   F#0 / c#7   (DDJ-SZ)
  loop 2x:    G0  / D7    (DDJ-SZ)
  search <<:  a#6 (e8=long) / a5    (DDJ-1000)
  search >>:  b6  (f8=long) / b5    (DDJ-1000)
    
	play/pause: b-1 / b4
	cue:        c0  / c5
	
	

    
    
DDJ-1000 screens support:
-------------------------
  Method 1: 
   - VirtualDJ managed to hack the proprietary Pioneer protocol to display full information. 
   - Documentation: nothing is public
   - Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8yeW9ONtGI

  Method 2: 
   - DjayPro uses simple MIDI commands to display only basic information. 
   - I've tried to use these midi out, but the traktor controller manager was not expressive enough to generate these exact midi out values 
   - MIDI-out is documented by pioneer on page 8 of their MIDI list. Screenshot: https://github.com/pestrela/music_scripts/blob/master/other/ddj-1000%20screens%20midi%20out.PNG
   - Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCUpDQD7i_M
   - Demo2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAUo4KMD70k   (Djay + Rekordbox)
   
 
 
TP3 MixerFX:
------------
 These can be changed in settings / mixer / mixerFX
 
 The default favorites are: 
  #1 flanger 
  #2 time gater 
  #3 noise 
  #4 crush 

 The macroFX favorites has 4x important effects. These sound as follows:
  #1 flanger hard
  #2 flanger soft
  #3 delay 
  #4 beatmasher


 Same, for second page of macroFX:
  #1 very hard flanger
  #2 hard flanger
  #3 crush
  #4 beatmasher

  #5 streetch
  #6 streetch
  #7 crush

    
  
DDJ-SX2 vs DDJ-SX3 vs DDJ-SZ:
-----------------------------
 - Sound Color FX buttons:
 
   - SX2:     NONE             (internal)
   - SX3:     ch7 note 0..3    (external)
   - SZ1:     ch7 note 0..3    (external)         (note 4..7 for oscillator buttons)

   - 1000RB:  ch7 note 0..3    (internal)
   - 1000SRT: ch7 note 0..3    (external)

   - RX:      ch7 note 16..19  (internal)
   - RZ:      ch7 note 0..3    (configurable)     (note 4..7 for oscillator buttons)
   - RZX:     ch7 note 0..3+36+37 (configurable)  (note 4..7 for oscillator buttons)
   
   - result: 
     - SX2:     ONLY use pads
     - SX3:     ONLY use pads 
     - SZ1:     ALSO use OSC buttons (this is to be done)
     - 1000RB:  CAN use color buttons  (this is unique)
     - 1000SRT: ONLY use pads
     
  
 - Grid adjust vs Pitch-n-time buttons:
   - SX2: C#9, A#-1
   - SX3: C#9, A#-1
   
   - result: these are the same midi codes, just different labelling
  

DDJ-1000SRT vs DDJ-1000RB:
--------------------------
  INTERNAL vs EXTERNAL:
  - SRT version is fully external mode; RB version is fully internal mode (except for beatFX master). 
  - For traktor this means we can have all the Pioneer effects (color + beat), and still put mixer/deck FX via the pads

  MIDI codes:
  - Decks: overall all the SRT physical buttons seem to match the RB midi codes. Example: search == beatjump
  - Pads: the pad codes match the SX2/SZ style of codes, and not the 1000RB style. This means that my SX2/SZ mapping is the best starting point for the 1000SRT

  JOGS SCREENS:
  - While the screens look to be MIDI (no waveforms & cover art), there is no public MIDI codes like in the original 1000 RB version

  I've now looked at the MIDI codes for the 1000 SRT version released today, and it is quite surprising: 
  - the SRT pad codes match the SX2/SZ style of codes, and not the 1000RB style 
  - While the screens look to be MIDI (no waveforms & cover art), there is no public MIDI codes like in the original 1000 RB version 

  this means that my SX2/SZ mapping is the best starting point for the 1000SRT for Traktor:  https://maps.djtechtools.com/mappings/9222

  
DDJ-400 SUPPORT:
----------------
  I've now tried my mapping on a DDJ-400 on a shop. 
  Most of the features do work - but it is definitively not ideal. 
  If I had a DDJ-400 myself I could easily make a specific version for it.


  Large parts of the DDJ-1000 map are compatible with the DDJ-400. 
  Caveats:
  - the DDJ-1000 cue mix / cue volume is done in hardware, so I don't duplicate this in traktor;  
    - the 400 requires adding these 2x commands (which are trivial to map)
  - RGB colors are not supported, so pad user feedback is gone. 
    - in the 1000 you get beautiful RBG colors for each function
  - "shift2" button does not exist, so my overlayed functions do not work (Beatjump, vinyl stop)
    - this can easily be mapped to the memory call buttons
  - the pad modes have a differnt order than the 1000 (Hot cue / beatlop / beatjump / sampler)
    - the functions are still accessible, but not on the documented positions
	
  
DDJ-800 test in a shop:
-----------------------
  what works fine:
   - all pads, hotcues, preview player, etc: all ok
   - jogFX: all ok
   - jogs scratch: same as ddj-1000
 
  problems:
  - loops: pioneer changes the codes quite a bit. 
     to start loop: ddj-1000 autoloop button is now ddj-800 loop in long press
     to exit loop: simplest is to use shift+reloop/exit. 
  
  bugs:   
   - beatFX: the channel selector is dead. the FX selector +depth works fine
   - colorFX selectors: this is now hold style instead of toggle style. So it needs to be hold
  
  -----   
  
  there is no auto loop button! instead this was replaced by "reloop"
     reloop = shift+outloop
  
     800:
      rellop/exit: C5
      cue call: a5/b5   -> same as search +shift (DDJ-1000)
      delete: d4   ->same as memory+shift on ddj-1000
      memory: == shift2, no problems
      
     1000: 
        4-beat/exit = g#0/G#5
     800:
        reloop/exit = f5/g#5  
  
  beat fx selector:
    E0/F0/F#0 etc  -> E1/F1 etc
    
  color fx selector:
    0,1,2,3 ->   0,1,2,3 (toggle)
  

  
Pioneer DDJ-1000 MIDI firmware bugs:
------------------------------------
 I've experienced the following bugs on the DDJ-1000 firmware (v1.0.6).
 This was confirmed by inpecting the MIDI messages generated / sent by the firmwar in both BOME and MIDI-OX.
 
 Test conditions:
   - both in "MIDI forced mode" and "Automatic mode". 
   - The issues were seen in DJay (https://www.algoriddim.com/hardware) 
   - and Traktor (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9tQZEHr8hk)
 
 
 a) RELEASING pads generates extra messages on the second page. Example:
      mode 1, page1, pad 1 (P1-L):
        97 00 7F
        97 00 00
        97 08 00    <<<<<< extra

 b) Deck 1/3 button (D6-L) always sends commands on channel 1. 
    As such the software cannot know which deck is active
    
    (same story for deck 2/4 button)

 c) jog screen sync indicator doesn't react (ch1 note F#6). 
    The master indicator works fine, however (ch1 note F6)
        
 d) Pressing and moving jog very slowing doesn't generate any midi messages.
    This was not the case for the DDJ-SZ, SX2, etc in MIDI mode. 
    This is also not the case for DDJ-1000 HID mode.
    
    This results in very poor accuracy for very tiny jog movements (beatgrid adjust, small scratch, high zooom levels).
    
 e) when channel 1..4 is selected (F9), the beatFX button (F11) still does not respond to ON/OFF messages. It seems it has its own state machine.
    result: button blinks when software is in off state
 
 
Pioneer DDJ-800 MIDI firmware bugs:
------------------------------------
  On the DDJ-800, firmware v1.0.1, I couldn't make the screens produce any MIDI output.
  this was both in "MIDI forced mode" and "Automatic mode". 
  The midi table is exactly the same as the DDJ-1000, but using the same code was a no-go.
  Sending the note A6 command directly also did not result at all.
  
 
About faders positions:
-----------------------
  use undocumented PC APP Connect to get faders positions:  
   ch 16 note A-1  (=9)    
   (mapping: page 1, linked to master volume)
 


  
How to force a certain sequence of events / sequential processing:
------------------------------------------------------------------
  Simple tricks:
    - Invert: using "invert on note ON is the simplest way to separate commands
    - "save snapshot FX": helps changing effects in instant gratification, as the next time it is already with the last value you put

  Tests:
    Sequence: 
      loop move by loop amount
      loop size decrease
    result: 
      first it moves by 4, then decrease loop to size 2
      (this was the case when the commands had different IDs, ie, different entering orders on the TSI)
