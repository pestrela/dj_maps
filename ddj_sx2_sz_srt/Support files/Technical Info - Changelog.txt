  Please don't be disrespectful for the time that people spend to make complex mappings.

UNIFIED MAPPING CHANGELOG - DETAILS:
------------------------------------
- v6.8.1 DDJ-1000 - May 2020 - TBD
 v6.8.0 was unreleased. 
 I'm currently recoding large parts of the mapping to enable more features and improve performance a lot.

Done:
  - beatFX layer redone
  - whole blink layer redone
  - removed page 2 hotcues delete
  - moved from 6 pages to 3 pages
  
  
TBD:
  - simplified slicer
  - backwards loop
  - loop adjust on pressing
  - superknob configurable + deck3/4 for macroFX
  - HC4500 elapsed time


- v6.8.0 DDJ-1000 - April 2020 - "the SuperKnob / TTFX edition"  (unreleased)
 - Short summary:
   Another big update to the DDJ-1000/800 Traktor mapping. 
   Biggest features is turntableFX on play/pause; Filter Superknobs to select FXs on each side; 
   New double click gestures; many improvements to Tempo; and Initialization/Reset fixes.
   
 - New features:
   - TurnTable FX: added TTFX sound to play/pause, on both regular and Flux mode situations (regular: trigger mode; flux: hold mode)
   - Filter SuperKnob: The filter knob now does 2x different HPF FX, one for each side. Use shift todo LPF instead; use memory todo disable this feature (does classic LPF+HPF).  
   - MacroFX shortcut: Double tap the CFX selection button to quick select macroFX (laserslicer, flighttest, etc)
   - MFX enabled: It is now possible to turn on MFXs at an wanted values away from the midpoint
   
 - Tempo:
   - Tempo range enlarger: moving the tempo fader enlarges and contracts the tempo range as required
   - Tempo blink: when physical tempo fader doesn't match the real one ("soft takeover"), the value blinks as a warning
   - Elastic beatgrid Sync: turning the jogwheel disables sync. This is useful for emulated elastic beatgrids. Use shift+memory+sync to toggle this feature
   
 - Gestures:
   - Memory button: Double tap: toggle time-elasped/time-remain; Long press: preview total time
   - Deck select: Double tap: toggle parallel/classic views; Shift+tap: disable layout changes
   - Jog Ring: now blinks to warn special situations (jogFX, Reverse, EOT); Flux mode now blinks as well
   
 - Various:
   - Beatjump buttons: Swapped main and shift functions to match DDJ-1000SRT
   - Faders initialization: The mapping now queries the initial positions at startup ("pc app connect" undocumented feature)
   - Bugfixes: Several bugfixes on CDJ blink, parallel waveforms
 
 
- v6.7.0 DDJ-SZ/SX2 - March 2020 - "BOME migration edition"
  - Short summary:
    A major jump for the SX2/SZ/SRTmapping, I've now managed to merge the DDJ-1000 mapping to the SX2/SZ/SRT family of controllers.
    This is the first release with BOME; many more features are already coded and will be released soon.

    Biggest features are all pad modes in the front, dedicated beatjump buttons, preview player and loop adjust with the jog, 
  
  - New features:
    - Pad modes: All most-used pad modes have been moved to the front 
    - Beatjump: New dedicated beatjump buttons
    - Layouts: panel = Classic/parallel change
    - Loops: can now ajust loops with the jogwheels
    - Preview player: (routed to deck 4 on external mode, with safety)
  
 
- v6.6.0 DDJ-1000 - September 2019 - "the CDJ edition"
  - Short summary:
     - CDJ-like features (loop IN/OUT, loop adjust, cue/Play blink, warning blink)
     - new manual beatjump shortcut. Includes "move me by one beat". 
     - new pads modes: beatjump, manual loop, keyshift modes.
     - configurable sync modes (Traktor/Serato style). Configurable cue monitor styles.
     - Several bugfixes on the jog screens 
  
  - New features (detailed):
     - Loop: Loop section now works like CDJs via IN/OUT button. 4-beat loop and auto-loop is still there.
     - Loop: Can now adjust the loop start/end with the jog. This is a major feature for eighties music (no beatgrids).  (shift+loop_in)
     - Loop: can now activate a saved loops (shift+auto_loop), and manually set loops (memory+auto_loop)
     - Beatjump: Search buttons are now beatjump/loop move size. Shift+search does beatjump/loop move; use memory+search to "move you by one beat" 
     - Pad Beatjump: added whole new pad mode for manual beatjumps and autoloops
     - Keyboard: added a key shift page with 3x sub-modes: CUP mode, CUE mode and Play mode
     - Blink: Cue and play button now blink like CDJs. The Cue button blinks when you can redefine the temporary cue; the Play button blinks when the track is paused.
     - End warning: Jog ring now blinks when the track is ending. There is 3x urgency speeds.

  - Bug fixes (detailed):
     - Screens: Jog needle no longer starts playing by itself
     - Screens: Jog needle now resets when pressing hotcue
     - Screens: BPM now works with changing tempo range (shift+master_tempo)
