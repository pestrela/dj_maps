There are THREE versions of the mapping: FREE w/bome, FREE wo/bome, and PAID. 

What are the differences?

a) The v6.3.3 FREE version WITHOUT bome is very old, doesn't have unique features like jogscreens, and will not get any updates moving forward.
However installation is the simplest and it DOESNT require a bome license.

b) The v6.8 FREE version WITH bome is much newer, has unique features like jogscreens / CDJ led blinks / CDJ loop adjust. 
The documentation and the installation guide is only updated for this version as well.
However it is harder to install, and it will require A BOME 60 EUR LICENSE AFTER TESTING.

c) The v7.0 PAID version WITH bome version was redone from scratch, 
and got a huge list of new features in the process 
(16x superknobs, stems, remix deck recorder, turntableFX, tempo enlarger, ...).

Documentation is now extremely complete with hundreds of pdf pages, hours of step-by-step videos, etc.

The cost is 30Eur paypal or Bank transfer. This price includes future updates to this mapping.
Note this cost is seperate from the 60 eur BOME license cost.
