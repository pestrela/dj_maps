README FIRST:
-------------

 Be sure to check the QUICK_START.pdf file on the root folder.
 
 This has the most CRUCIAL INFORMATION:
  - what is available documentation
  - differences to rekordbox shortcuts
  - how to enable advanced features (everything is shipped DISABLED on purpose)
 
 Eveything else (manuals and installation guides) are in the DOCUMENTATION sub-folder instead.
