  - for deck 3+4, per channel mixerFX doesn't change mixerFX when 16x filters are disabled
     deck 1+2 are ok
  - TTFX: no need to mess around with dry/wet.
     button ON + value=desired / press pause / value=MAX / button=OFF
   -setting parallel/classic by hand should not disable auto layout

Correct Initialization Sequence:
--------------------------------
 - Correct Initialization Sequence:
   - First DDJ device
   - then BOME
   - then Traktor
   - then CMDR (if needed)
 - Restarting
   - you can now close and reopen traktor at will.
   - do not close either BOME or CMDR (if it is running)
 - Any Problems? 
   - check "port closed" on BOME log window (click "outgoing")
   - press shift+quantize (=wake up) to force a "send monitor state"

   
Notes from VDJ DDJ-1000 mapping:
--------------------------------
  padFX:
    pale color. pressing color = bright that color
  
  beatFX:
    channel and master = software effects
    ON/OFF = per effect, changes to OFF when changing
    small screen is updated to VDJ effects

DDJ-1000 differences between MIDI and HID mode:
-----------------------------------------------
  (note: this was moved to mixxx wiki)

  (note1: IN/OUT is from the point of view of the software)
  (note2: tests done in virtual DJ)

  - BeatFX ON/OFF button:
    - MIDI:
      - OUT: This button has its own state machine. It doesn't react to sending a MIDI message, so we can't reset it
      - IN: There is no visibility of the blinking status. Pressing the button always output a TOGGLE message
    - HID: VirtualDJ has full control
      
  - BeatFX Screen:
    - MIDI: No visibility or control. The screen always shows the Pioneer effects and their values. These Pioneer effects are ONLY applied on the master channel
    - HID: VirtualDJ has full control. Master channel is VDJ effects. If an analog source is choose, the Pioneer effects return for that channel.
    
  - SoundColorFX buttons:
    - MIDI: 
      - IN: button blinks by itself, even when using shift+button 
      - OUT: button reacts to stop blinking
    - HID: Unknown
    
  - JogScreens:
    - MIDI:
      - OUT: fair amount of controls. Sync led doesn't react (firmware bug acknowledged by support)
    - HID:
      - OUT: adds Waveforms, tempo range, cuescope, cover art
       
  - Deck select:
    - MIDI: 
      - IN: no visibility on the active deck; the firmware always return channel 3/4 regardless of the active channel. The active channel needs to be inferred by later messages.
      - OUT: no reaction
    - HID: unknown 
    
  - Pad Page:
    - MIDI: 
       - IN: it has its own state machine, per pad mode
       - OUT: no reaction
    - HID: Full control; Hotcues have 2 subpages; Loops mode have >4 sub-pages  
     
     
     
Jog Needle State machine:
-------------------------
  inputs: 
    - play/pause
    - cue
    - jog touch
  
  state machine: 
    stopped -> [play] -> playing 
    playing -> [/play] -> paused 
    paused -> [play] -> playing 
        
    stopped -> [cue] -> cueing
    cueing -> [/cue] -> move to front -> stopped
    
    playing -> [cue] -> move to front -> stopped
    paused -> [cue] -> set new cue -> stopped

    playing -> [jog] -> jogging
    jogging -> [/jog] -> playing
    
              
   states: 
    stopped: 0
    playing: 1
    cueing: 2
 

SWALLOW - which rules apply to all inputs:
------------------------------------------
  - double click
  - long press
  - auto layout
    - CFX pads (pad channels only)
  - Remix decks pads
  

  
BOME - Possible action outcomes:
--------------------------------
  skip outgoing action

  execute outgoing action
    pass message, no further action
    pass message, AND do further action
  
    do swallow, no further action
    do swallow, AND do further action

    
  IMPORTANT: always do swallows at the END. 
  If you can't, the other rules need to "skip" or "exit with swallow" as well
  
  
MIDI routing:
-------------
  - All messages are routed by default (main project / settings / midi router)
  - processed messages use "swallow" to not be broadcasted
  - all processed messages are on the BMT1->DDJ direction
    - exception: jog turn is on the DDJ->BMT1 direction
  - all outputs on the traktor side need "blend"   
  - "mod 360" calculations: after mod, negative values need to be made positive by adding 360
   - oo = oo % 360
   - if oo < 0 then oo = oo + 360

  - Main path:    Traktor -> (BMT1) -> bome -> (DDJ-1000)
  - Reverse path: Traktor <- (BMT1) <- bome <- (DDJ-1000)


  I believe the unexpected problem here is that the “swallow” flag is only activated 
  if both incoming trigger AND the Rules section pass. If “exit rules, skip Outgoing Action” 
  is hit, then even if “swallow” is checked, it won’t swallow from this translator. 
  You can, as you’ve done in your test preset, activate “swallow” from a different 
  translator without rules and without outgoing action. 

  In other words, the swallow flag is only evaluated when the Outgoing Action is executed 
  (even if it\'s the \"None\" action).

RESET SCREENS PROCEDURE:
------------------------
  Pressing shift+quantize: ch1..4 A3 (57)
    @BOME:
      sends Ch16.A-1 to DDJ-1000   
      sends ch1 A3 to traktor  (ie, no swallow)
    @TRAKTOR:
      send monitor state

  at initialization:
     "hx" = 0
  
  at first press of any DDJ button:
     "hx" = 1
     call reset

  at first receive of anything from traktor:  (TODO)
     "hx" = 1
     call reset

midi device reset:
------------------
  https://www.bome.com/support/kb/explicitelly-reset-a-device-or-the-whole-midimanager

  Is there a rule to explicitly reset (close+open) a midi devices in Windows, in bome 1.8.4 ?
  Alternatively, is there a way to schedule a restart of the whole midimanager?

  my issue: 
  Unplugging the USB cable of my DDJ-1000 results in the leds becoming dead. This is completely repetable.
  The MIDI_IN initially comes up as well, but then somebody (the driver or the FW) gives it a reset, which makes it work without any manual interaction.

  In this situation, the only workaround is to manually restart the midi_manager on the big red button.

  ------
  
  When I swap the USB cable of my DDJ-1000, both the Audio and the Midi_IN device recover automatically. This is very good.

  However the MIDI_OUT device remains dead, and no LEDs change any more. 

  To fix this I need to manually restart my software, reopening all the MIDI devices.


  I've inspected what happens in BOME, and the difference is that either the driver or the firmware reset the MIDI_IN device a second time.
  Can I ask the same to happen for the MIDI_OUT device as well?

  below the BOME log.

  thank you!

NEW CLOCKS and BLINK METHODS:
----------------------------
  what blinks:
    cue button: flashes when a new cue can be set
    play/pause: lighted when playing track, and flashes when paused
    end warning: 30s;
    fast end warning: 15s

  variables:  
    "g0" - master t_blink       counts to 16, 125ms, period 2 seconds
    
    "zx" - very slow - 0.5 blink per second  - slip, play
    "zy" - slow      - 1 blinks second       - cue
    "zw" - fast      - 2 blinks second       - jogring, sync
    "zz" - very fast - 4 blinks per second   - jogring, sync


  about leds and blinks:
    All blinking leds are fully managed inside BOME. This includes in some cases the shifted version.
    to blink, we iterate the values in a timer.
    On these leds its easy to show the configuration status (on the shifted value)
      best example: sync / shift master, for sync aid and tempo enlarger features.
      
    Some leds are not managed by BOME, but they could in the future.
    While the configuration is done in BOME, that one is not shown. 
      best example: shift+play, for TTFX.

     --> Y2 = calculated BPM



HOW TO CONVERT RANGES:
----------------------
  Input  = 0..127
  Output = 20..90

  O = int(( I * out_range) / in_range) + offset)
    = I * 70 / 127 + 20
    (to add more precision: use 1E3 before and after)

ADVANCED BOME INTEGRATION - 14-bit out messages:
------------------------------------------------
  Q2: The BPM and Percentage values are very close, but not exactly the same, of what it displayed on the laptop screen
  A2: Reason: Traktor lacks high-resolution MIDI out messages. Even so, a trick was already implemented to improve accuracy 10x times (compared to a naive mapping).

  T2: Traktor receives 14-bit messages just fine (combo messages), but cannot send it.
  This was confirmed by hacking CMDR to generate a valid TSI of a combo message - nothing got sent by Traktor.

  As a workaround, accuracy was improved 10x by creating 10x separate 7-bit ranges, each on a separate CC, and reacting to only a part of the whole range, eg: 0.0->0.1; 0.1->0.2; 0.2->0.3; ...
  This lead to the next problem: when the value crosses multiple ranges, potentially all, then all of them independently react with their extreme values. Note that these output values also follow a non-deterministic order.
  This was addressed as follows: collect all outputs until a 10ms timer expires, and ignore the extreme values, keeping only the final intermediate value (which can come in any order).
  If really going to an extreme value, in particular 0.0 or 1.0, collect that with 11th low resolution CC that encompasses the whole range.
  After the timer expires, process the single value as normal
  Q3: The time elapsed/remain is approximate to what is displayed on the laptop screen. Ans/Or, the seconds advances either too fast or too slow.
  A3: Reason: Traktor doesn't send the absolute minutes:seconds position, only the relative percentage position instead.
  The mapping guesses the total track length using an internal clock.
  press shift+quantize (="Wake up") while the track is playing to reset the measurement process.

  
  
ADVANCED BOME INTEGRATION - Absolute track position emulation:
-------------------------------------------------------------
  T3: even with the high-resolution trick explained above, it is still a relative position.
  To transform this into an absolute value, we implement a master clock in BOME with a timer every 100ms. On the seek position code we measure how many ticks elapsed when 0.5% of the track has elapsed without any jumps or interruptions.
  When we have this value, a simple multiplication by 200 gives the estimated track length, to which is then trivial to calculate elapsed/remain values in MM:SS format.
  As mentioned, pressing shift+quantize triggers a "send monitor state" command that resends all values, restarting the measurement process.

  
  
ADVANCED BOME INTEGRATION - Needle progress emulation:
------------------------------------------------------
  Q4: Needle position sometimes jumps around after scratching.
  A4: Traktor lacks a "jog turn out message", so this is emulated in BOME. Please join the DJTT discussion to improve this in the next version.

  T4: The best message to implement the needle position is "beat phase". Significant amount of time was spend using this message. 
  It only sends the -45deg..45deg information. This is accumulated internally to a 0deg..360deg value that is displayed for the user.
  When the user seeks away, we just get a new 45deg position, unlinked to the actual 360 position. (this could be improved by merging with the 1000 points seek 
  relative position descried above).
  Instead, we implemented the full state machine of the deck (stopped, playing, cueing), interpreted the jog touch and jog turn messages directly 
  from the device (instead of traktor), and advanced the needle using the internal fake clock.
    
    
    
EXPERIMENTS ON MIDI LINKED MODIFIERS (MLM):
------------------------------------------
  please read the MLM discussion on page 86 and following of 
   "RUDI-Js ELEPHANT TSI for VCI-400SE + Maschine (MK1) + BCR 2000 v2.0"
   
  experiment:
   CC 1..4 - sync on
   modifier 1..4 = sync on, per deck
   
   CC 11..14 - master on
   modifier 8 = master deck 
   
   cc 21 - send value of modifier 8 out
   
   page 2: modifier 8 = global modifier
   

  to send a value directly to a MODIFIER:
    bome: set variable to 0..7; send it as a value
    traktor: modifier IN / Fader / Relative / 100% sensitivity / 0% Acceleration
    
  to send a value directly to a deck layout:
    bome: set variable to 0..4; (send it + 0) * 127 / 4
    traktor: modifier IN / Fader / Direct
    (doing this to a modifier will print garbage, and use the last digits only)
    
  to send simple boolean ON/OFF:
    traktor: modifier IN / button / hold / 1

Use cases: macOS version:
-------------------------      
  macOS version - superknob off:
    no translation done
    pressing color button = changes single mixerFX for all chanels
    
    turning knob - no translation
    
  superknob on:
    color buttons select both mixerFX and macroFX
    filter#1 is kept to mixerFX
    filter#3 translated to macroFX (new code)
    
    pad buttons do the same, BUT FOR THAT DECK ONLY

BeatFX state machine:
---------------------
  ON/OFF = ch05 B4 (=71)
    traktor: hold (=remote control)
 
    tested that this button always sends 127 when pressed, 0 when release. THUS NO VISIBILITY ON TRUE VALUE.
    PC app connect - no reaction
    
     
  channel select: ch05 E0..G0 (16..19);  other = 20..22
  
  "h0" = real ON/OFF button state
  "h9" = which deck selected: 0 = master/mic/sampler; 1..4 = decks

  input: 24 00 -> 25 FF   (turn off previous one, turn on new one)
  
  conclusion: 
    - do store preset on parameter up/down; dry/wet; master on/off
  
  selector:
    old FX 00 -> dry=0 (invert)
    old FX 7F - select new effect
    old FX 7f (delayed) - turn on button 
      (CH5 C-1 SPECIAL NOTE)  <<<<<<
    
  ddj_1000 knob beatfx:   (dedicated kontrols for unit4)
    no shift:  CC10+42       beatFX dry/wet  (ddj_1000 case, no shift)

    shift2:    CC12+44       beatFX parameter2 (dry/wet+shift2)
    shift3:    CC13+45      (no action)

    
How beatFX works:
-----------------
  DDJ SX2 uses channel 5 and 6: 
     CCs  0,2,4,6,
     +shift: 16,18,20,22
     
     this makes it access all 4x FX units
     
  DDK-1000 uses channel 5 and CC 2. 
    There is no hardware shift. There is no other CCs. No channel 6.
    -> in BOME we swallow that specifc message and replace with entirely new messages

  ON/OFF: note ch5.b4 is also shared
     -> we send ch5.C-1 instead (this was free)
    
  To merge the mapping, I've added these messages back  
  
 
traktor remote control by BOME:
-------------------------------
  direct = 0/1  (change state) 
  hold = remote control :   127 -> 1  /  0 -> 0
  toggle:   (no visibility except if an OUT command as well)
