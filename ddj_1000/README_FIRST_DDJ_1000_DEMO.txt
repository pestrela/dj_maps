------------------
 
  This ZIP file contains TWO versions of the mapping: v6.3.3 FREE and v7.2 DEMO


What are the differences?
-------------------------

  a) The v6.3.3 FREE version has all the basics to DJing. Installation is simple and it DOESNT require a bome license.
  However is doesn't have unique features like jogscreens, and will not get any updates moving forward.

  b) The v7.2 version was redone from scratch, and got a huge list of new features in the process 
  (JogScreens, 16x superknobs, stems, remix deck recorder, turntableFX, tempo enlarger, fast preferences window, ...).

  Documentation is now extremely complete with hundreds of pdf pages, hours of step-by-step videos, etc.
  In this DEMO, deck A has all the features of the paid version, but the other decks are disabled.

How can I buy the full version?
-------------------------------

  The cost of the FULL version is 30Eur paypal or Bank transfer. Price includes future updates.
  Note this cost is seperate from the 60 eur BOME license cost.
