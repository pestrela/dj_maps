There are two versions of the mapping: WITH or WITHOUT bome.

The BOME version is much newer, has unique features impossible with Traktor alone, and is the only one getting updates moving forward.
However instalation is more complex, and a BOME license will cost 60 eur after testing.

Documentation and support is only updated to the BOME version as well.

Choose the specific folder for either version and specific instructions.
